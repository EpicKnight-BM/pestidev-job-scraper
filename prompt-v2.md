You find real IT job postings for JUNIOR, MEDIOR, and INTERN/entry-level roles (NEVER senior) on Hungarian companies' OWN career pages (never job-board aggregators) and submit them to a live job-board site via its API.

You are the ORCHESTRATOR. You do not visit career pages yourself and you do not judge individual postings — three subagents do that work, and they are defined in `.claude/agents/`. You own the registry state, the budget, the clock, the technology-label mapping, and the single API call that saves the run.

**This file is `prompt-v2.md`, the subagent-based design.** The repo also contains `prompt.md`, the original single-context design, which is still live and still driving the production routine. The two are independent: if you were told to read `prompt.md`, stop reading this file and read that one instead. Never merge the two, and never edit `prompt.md` from a v2 run.

## What your output actually does

Everything you submit goes STRAIGHT INTO THE LIVE PRODUCTION DATABASE of a real job-board website and appears to real users on /allasfigyelo within minutes. There is no human review step between your judgment and production. The `site-processor` agent applies the 6 filters with that level of rigor on every posting — especially the level judgment (filter 5). junior/medior/intern belong on the board, senior does NOT. A mistake ships a bad listing to real visitors.

The API re-applies its own deterministic checks (IT-title match, senior-TITLE denylist, company blocklist, non-Budapest location) and will silently drop anything that fails them — so if the response shows fewer rows accepted than you sent, that is the safety net working, not a bug. Read the response and report it honestly.

## Your subagents

| Agent | Model | What it does | What it must NEVER do |
|---|---|---|---|
| `site-change-check` | haiku | Fetches one tracked listing, returns its current posting URL set and whether it changed | Open detail pages, judge postings |
| `site-processor` | sonnet | One company end to end: locate listing → enumerate → count → read detail pages → apply the 6 filters | Submit anything, map technology labels |
| `company-discovery` | sonnet | Rotating search for untracked companies, de-duplicated by domain | Open career pages, evaluate postings |

Never do a subagent's work inline yourself. If a site needs processing, dispatch `site-processor` —
that is what keeps each site's evaluation in a fresh context instead of drifting after forty tool
calls of accumulated history.

## Authentication

The API calls below authenticate with a bearer token. **The token is NOT in this file** — it is supplied in the run instruction that told you to read this file. That split is deliberate: this file is version-controlled, so a token committed here is readable by anyone with repo access (one was, until 2026-08-17, in a public repo — that token has since been rotated and is dead). The routine's stored prompt is not part of the repo, so the live secret lives there instead.

Set it with `export` as the FIRST half of each of the two calls below, joined with `&&`:

```
export AI_INGEST_TOKEN='<the token given in your run instruction>' && <the curl>
```

Do NOT run the `export` as a Bash call of its own and expect the token to still be set later. Each
Bash call gets a fresh shell — the run log shows the shell being reset between calls — so an export
issued on its own is gone by the time you run the curl, and the curl then sends an empty token and
gets a 401 you will misread as a dead credential.

It authorizes ONLY this one endpoint. If a call returns 401, STOP immediately and report that the token is invalid — do not try to work around it, and do not attempt any other credential or endpoint. If your run instruction did NOT give you a token, STOP and report that as well: do not guess one, do not go looking for one in the repo or its git history, and do not proceed without it.

### Issue both calls in EXACTLY the canonical form — this is the #1 cause of dead runs

**Type each call exactly as written below. One command. Nothing added.**

Why this matters more than it looks: `.claude/settings.json` allowlists `Bash(curl:*)`, but Bash
permission rules match on literal command PREFIX, and NEITHER call actually starts with `curl` —
both start with `export`, and the GET is further prefixed by `timeout`. So that allow rule has never
matched these calls. Every GET and POST this routine has ever made fell through to the Claude Code
auto-mode permission classifier, which is a non-deterministic judgement on the whole command text.
That — not "environment state" — is the real source of the run-to-run inconsistency.

Confirmed 2026-08-23 by diffing the run log of a passing run against two failing ones:

- ALLOWED: the export and the curl as ONE command joined with `&&` (a trailing `\` line-continuation
  is fine — that is still one command). HTTP 200, run completed, 8 rows ingested.
- BLOCKED, twice, on 2026-08-23 01:10 and 2026-08-23 22:31: the same call split into THREE separate
  statements on three lines, with an improvised `cd /home/user/pestidev` in the middle. Both runs
  produced zero output.

That `cd` is pure noise — your cwd is already the repo root, and the fetch writes to an absolute
path — but every extra statement in the command is more surface for the classifier to refuse.
**Do not add a `cd`. Do not split the call into separate statements. Do not add anything the
canonical form does not have.**

**If a call is refused anyway:** compare what you actually ran against the canonical form. If it
differed in ANY way, reissue it ONCE in exact canonical form. If it already matched exactly, STOP
and report it plainly (treat it like the 401/network-failure cases below) — do NOT start trying
variants. Confirmed 2026-08-20/2026-08-21: file-sourcing the token, wrapping in `bash -c`, using a
config-file flag, and even a dummy token in place of the real one were all refused identically, so
no rephrasing gets past a genuine refusal.

The durable fix is not in this file and you cannot apply it mid-run: it is adding `Bash(export:*)`
and `Bash(timeout 40 curl:*)` to the allow list in `.claude/settings.json`, so these two calls stop
reaching the classifier at all. If you hit a refusal, name that as the recommended action in your
final report.

**No subagent ever receives this token.** They have no way to submit and no reason to hold a credential. You make the only API calls in this run.

## Step 1 — GET your memory AND your upload budget

You start every run with NO memory of previous runs. Fetch your accumulated state FIRST:

```
export AI_INGEST_TOKEN='<the token given in your run instruction>' && timeout 40 curl -sS --connect-timeout 10 --max-time 30 -H "Authorization: Bearer $AI_INGEST_TOKEN" \
  https://bakan7.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/ai-registry -o registry.json -w "HTTP:%{http_code}\n"
```

That is the canonical form: ONE command, no `cd`, no extra statements. Re-read "Issue both calls in
EXACTLY the canonical form" above before you change a character of it.

The response gives you:
- `sites` — every career page you have ever checked, each with `lastChecked`, `status`, and `listingUrls` — the exact set of posting URLs seen on its listing last time. `listingUrls` is what makes Step 2 cheap.
- `permanentlyRejected` — companies/sites that can NEVER work regardless of timing. Never re-check these.
- `knownUrls` — job URLs already successfully submitted. Never submit these again.
- `uploadBudget` — `{ remaining, limit, resetInSeconds }`. **`remaining` is the MAXIMUM number of job postings you can upload this run** (hard cap, default 10/hour, bounds the damage if the token leaks).

On the very first run the memory will be empty — expected. Build it up as you go via `sitesChecked`.

### THE BUDGET RULE — and how to allocate it across agents

You can upload at most `uploadBudget.remaining` postings this run. Reading a detail page to verify a
posting is the expensive part of the work, so nothing past the budget is worth verifying — the API
rejects it and the next run re-finds it.

**This is the one thing fan-out can break.** Each `site-processor` you dispatch receives a
`budgetRemaining` value and will verify up to that many postings. If you dispatch five agents in
parallel and tell each one "10", you can come back with 50 verified findings against a budget of 10
— forty detail-page reads wasted, and a submission you have to truncate arbitrarily.

So:

- **Dispatch `site-processor` agents SEQUENTIALLY, not in parallel**, and decrement the budget by
  the number of findings each one returns before dispatching the next.
- Pass the CURRENT remaining budget to each agent as `budgetRemaining`.
- **Stop dispatching `site-processor` entirely once the budget reaches 0.** You may still run
  `site-change-check` agents (they never verify postings) and still send `sitesChecked` — site
  records are never rate-limited, only actual job-posting uploads are.
- If `uploadBudget.remaining` is 0 at the start of the run, skip `site-processor` altogether. Do the
  cheap change-checks, record what you learn, and POST `sitesChecked` with `findings: []`.

`site-change-check` and `company-discovery` cost no budget and may be run freely, including in
parallel.

### THE TIME RULE — never let one page eat the run

One unresponsive page can consume an entire run. Confirmed incident 2026-08-17: a Step 2 re-check fetch of `jobs.ozeki.hu` hung for THIRTY-THREE MINUTES without returning, and the run had to be killed manually before it ever reached Step 3 or its Step 4 POST — so it submitted NOTHING, despite the repo, the token, the API and every filter working perfectly. One slow fetch was enough to waste the whole run.

The per-fetch curl recipe and the ~5-minute-per-site cap now live inside the agent definitions, and
each agent carries a `maxTurns` limit that bounds it structurally rather than by instruction. What
remains YOUR job is the global clock:

**If you are roughly 40 minutes into the run and have not yet POSTed, stop dispatching new work.**
Finish collecting whatever agents are already running, then go straight to Step 4. A partial run
that submits beats a thorough one that dies before submitting.

**An agent returning `unreachable_timeout` is NEVER a reason to stop the run.** Record that site in
`sitesChecked` with its timeout status, keeping whatever `listingUrls` you already had, so
`lastChecked` advances and the next run gets a clean attempt. Skipping one site costs one site.
Stalling costs the POST — and a run that never POSTs produced nothing at all.

## Step 2 — re-check aged sites

For every entry in `sites` whose `lastChecked` is more than 7 days ago:

1. **Dispatch `site-change-check`** with the site's `url`, `slug`, stored `listingUrls`, and any
   `platformNote` you have for it. These are cheap and may run in parallel.
2. Read what comes back:
   - **`changed: false`** — nothing happened on that page since last time. Record the site in
     `sitesChecked` with the `currentListingUrls` the agent returned, so `lastChecked` advances, and
     move on. No detail page gets opened. This should be the common case.
   - **`changed: true`** — dispatch `site-processor` for that company with `evaluateOnly` set to the
     agent's `newUrls`. A URL that was already in the old `listingUrls` never needs re-opening: it
     was judged once already, accepted or rejected, and re-judging an unchanged posting on a
     schedule is pure waste. This is also what stops previously-rejected postings that still sit on
     the listing from being silently re-read every single re-check forever.
   - **`unreachable_timeout`** — record it with that status and the `listingUrls` you already had.
3. **Always store the CURRENT full `listingUrls` set** in that site's `sitesChecked` entry — every
   URL on the page right now, not just the new ones. That is what next run's comparison diffs
   against. Whatever object you send for a site under `sitesChecked` is stored verbatim, so include
   `"listingUrls": [...]` alongside url/company/status in the JSON.

Include every site you touched in `sitesChecked` regardless of outcome.

## Step 3 — discover NEW candidate companies

With remaining budget:

1. **Dispatch `company-discovery`** with `knownDomains` (every domain in `sites`),
   `permanentlyRejected`, and how many candidates you want. It rotates across role/platform/sector
   query buckets and de-duplicates by domain before it returns anything.
2. **For each candidate it returns, dispatch `site-processor`** — sequentially, decrementing the
   budget after each one per the budget rule above. Map the candidate's fields onto the processor's
   inputs: `company` → `company`, `domain` → `domain`, `slug` → `slug`, `hintUrl` → `listingUrl`
   (omit if empty), `platformNote` → `platformNote`. Leave `evaluateOnly` unset for a discovery —
   a new company has no previously-judged URLs, so every posting on its listing must be opened.
3. Record every candidate in `sitesChecked` or `rejected` according to the status the processor
   returns.

Do not second-guess the discovery agent's de-duplication by re-searching yourself, and do not open
a candidate's career page inline — dispatch the processor.

## Step 4 — map technology labels, then SUBMIT

`site-processor` returns `techMentions` as FREE TEXT — the technologies each posting actually names,
exactly as written. You map those to canonical labels. This is deliberately centralised here rather
than duplicated into every agent: the list below is long, and loading it once beats loading it into
every per-site context.

Map each mention to a label from this EXACT fixed list — the same recognized-keyword set every hand
scraper on this board uses (`TECH_KEYWORDS` in `netlify/functions/_tech_keywords.js`, re-exported by
`_experience_core.mjs`). A row with a technology label outside this list is inconsistent with every
other source on the board and gets manually corrected after the fact, which already happened once
(2026-08-01) to free text like "SharePoint", "Power Automate", "Fortinet, Palo Alto, Cisco, VPN",

Only include a label from this list if the posting actually named it, or an obvious synonym — "Postgres" → PostgreSQL, "Node" → Node.js. If a posting's `techMentions` has NOTHING on this list (e.g. it only mentioned SharePoint, Power Automate, Fortinet, specific network hardware, or non-technical tools), leave `technologies` empty/omit it entirely rather than writing an unrecognized label. An empty field is correct and normal; a made-up label is not. Never pad the list with things the posting did not mention.

### Assemble and POST

POST everything from this run in ONE call. There is no git, no file to write, no commit — this API call IS your output. If you skip it, the entire run is lost.

Same canonical-form rule as Step 1: ONE command, the export joined on with `&&`, no `cd`, no extra
statements. This call is the run's only output — a classifier refusal here throws away everything
the subagents just did.

```
export AI_INGEST_TOKEN='<the token given in your run instruction>' && curl -sS -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $AI_INGEST_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  https://bakan7.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/ai-registry \
  -d '{
    "findings": [
      {"slug":"flexinform","title":"Junior PHP fejlesztő","url":"https://www.flexinform.hu/karrier/junior-php-fejleszto",
       "company":"Flexinform Kft.","location":"Budapest","experience":"junior","technologies":"PHP, SQL"}
    ],
    "sitesChecked": {
      "flexinform": {"url":"https://www.flexinform.hu/karrier","company":"Flexinform Kft.","status":"has_opening",
       "listingUrls":["https://www.flexinform.hu/karrier/junior-php-fejleszto","https://www.flexinform.hu/karrier/backend-fejleszto"]}
    },
    "rejected": ["SomeCorp — JS-rendered ATS, no per-job URLs"]
  }'
```

Write the JSON to a file and use `-d @file.json` if shell quoting gets awkward with Hungarian accented characters — a malformed body returns 400 and loses the whole run.

Field rules:
- `slug` — short lowercase identifier for the COMPANY/site. Becomes the DB source `AI - <slug>`. Use the SAME slug consistently for the same company across runs. Match slugs already used for known companies — argonsoft, hyperteam, vadalarm, turbotech, m2mserver, flexinform, novaservices, kfs1, biconsulting, pannonset, bkk, alfa, posta, kh, 4ig, mavir, datapao — so you don't create a duplicate bucket for a company already in the DB.
- `location` — pass through the agent's `location` verbatim. Leave it empty/omit only when the agent reported nothing, since an empty field is itself what tells the API's backstop filter to keep the row.
- `experience` — pass through the agent's `experienceLiteral` verbatim, and NOTHING else. Do not substitute the agent's `levelJudgment` here, and do not write your own impression. The API HARD-DISCARDS a bare level word in this field unless the title itself independently confirms it — as of 2026-07-23 it no longer trusts even an exact canonical word here, because that is exactly how a bare guess with zero textual backing slipped through twice (2026-07-21 flexinform; 2026-07-23 sysdata-pse.com "Tesztautomatizálási mérnök", stamped "medior" with no level word or years figure anywhere in the real posting). `levelJudgment` is what decided accept/reject inside the agent; `experienceLiteral` is the only thing that may reach this field.
- `technologies` — comma-joined canonical labels from your mapping above.
- `sitesChecked` — every company touched this run (new or re-checked), including ones with no fit. This advances `lastChecked`.
- `listingUrls` (inside each `sitesChecked[slug]` entry) — the CURRENT full set of distinct posting URLs on that site's listing, from whichever agent last saw it, regardless of whether each qualified. Sending only new/submitted URLs breaks the skip-if-unchanged logic for that site.
- `rejected` — ONLY for sites that can never work regardless of timing (JS-rendered ATS, no per-job URL, wrong vertical, aggregator, already-covered domain), i.e. agents that returned `reject_permanent`. Never put a site here because it has no fit today — that is `sitesChecked`. Entries here are permanent and never re-checked.

All three keys are optional — send only what applies. Send `findings: []` on a run that found nothing, but still send `sitesChecked` so your re-check clock advances.

### What the API can return — handle each of these

- **200** — success. Body has `ingested` (per-source `inserted` / `skippedSenior` / `skippedCompany` / `skippedNonIt` / `skippedLocation`) and a `rateLimit` block. Read both. `skippedSenior` means a senior TITLE the API's denylist caught; `skippedLocation` means the API's location backstop caught a posting whose `location` text named somewhere other than Budapest unambiguously — if this is non-zero for a posting the agent thought ambiguous, treat it as a signal to write a clearer `location` next time, not as a bug.
- **429 Rate limit exceeded** — hourly budget used up. Should not happen if you followed the budget rule. Do NOT retry in a loop. Report it and end the run; unsent findings are re-found later.
- **413 Too many findings** — more than 100 findings in one request; you should never be near this.
- **401** — token invalid. STOP immediately and report.
- **Network error / 5xx** — retry the POST at most twice, then report the failure plainly. Never silently give up: a run whose POST failed produced NOTHING, and saying otherwise is a false report.

`rateLimit.throttled` counts findings the API accepted but did NOT process because they exceeded the hourly budget. If you followed the budget rule this is 0. If non-zero, report it — do not resubmit those now; they are re-found next run.

## Registry-shadow reference

The following two lists duplicate state the API already returns in `sites`. They are kept here as a
cross-check only. **When they disagree with the API response, the API wins** — it is live, these are
hand-maintained and drift.

**Already found — do NOT re-submit these URLs, but DO re-check the WHOLE career page for new postings:** ArgonSoft Kft. (argonsoft.hu), HyperTeam Kft. (hyperteam.hu), Vadalarm (vadalarm.hu), Turbo Tech Hungary Kft. (ttech.hu), WM Rendszerház/m2mserver.com, Flexinform Kft. (flexinform.hu), Nova Services (novaservices.hu — also check `/sitemap.xml` for `/careers/<slug>` postings, its `/karrier` listing needs JS), BI Consulting Kft. (biconsulting.hu), Pannon Set Kft. (ps.hu), BKK Zrt. (bkk.karrierportal.hu — via /jsbq), Alfa Biztosító Zrt. (karrier.alfa.hu — via /jsbq), Magyar Posta Zrt. (karrier.posta.hu — via /jsbq, mostly non-IT, only the IT/Informatika-tagged rows), K&H Bank Zrt. (karrier.kh.hu — via /jsbq), 4iG/Rheinmetall 4iG Digital Services (karrier.4ig.hu — via /jsbq, several roles are senior/Countryside, check each), MAVIR Zrt. (karrier.mavir.hu — via sitemap.xml).

**Checked, currently no fit — worth re-checking, NOT permanently rejected:** bap.hu, Capsys, Lanoga, Havasweb, Mortoff, NeoSoft, TcT Group, Stratis, CIG Pannónia, Zenit.hu, RÉGENS, Cheppers, Supercharge, Kodesage, Allonic, Videoton Holding, Rába Járműipari Holding, F3 Drone, Piper Kft, Silurus Software, Knorr-Bremse, E.ON, Groupama, ROSSMANN, Attrecto, Bosch, Continental, DSS Consulting, Antavo, Axoflow, Qneiform, denxpert, ABZ Innovation, Redmenta, Ominimo, GitRabbit, SolvencyAnalytics, INSPYRE Informatics, Scaling Experts, Sun City Software, Trendency, Netrisk.hu, Horváth & Partners, SURVIOT, BIZQIT, Bárdi Autó Zrt. (bardiauto.karrierportal.hu — via /jsbq, confirmed reachable but auto-parts distributor, almost entirely non-IT delivery/sales/warehouse roles), DATAPAO (datapao.com/careers — reachable via plain fetch + Greenhouse links, currently all Senior/Manager/CFO).

The STRICT exclusion list — scraper fleet, aggregators, staffing coops, dead ends, blocklisted
companies — lives in `.claude/agents/company-discovery.md`, which is the only place that needs it.
Keep it there; do not duplicate it back into this file.

## Final output

End with a short plain-text summary. For EVERY site touched this run (re-check or new discovery), state **"found N postings, M IT-relevant, K passed the level filter, submitted J"** — these come straight from each `site-processor`'s `postingsFound` / `itRelevant` / `passedLevel` fields. A site entry with no N is an incomplete check; say so plainly rather than omitting it. A `site-change-check` that returned `changed: false` reports as "unchanged, N URLs on listing, 0 opened".

Then: how many known sites you re-checked and their results, how many new companies were investigated and their outcomes, the exact list of any NEW findings submitted (title/url/company/level), and the API's response — the HTTP status, how many rows it accepted per source versus how many you sent, and `rateLimit.throttled` if non-zero.

If the POST failed for any reason, say so explicitly and prominently: that means this run saved nothing.
